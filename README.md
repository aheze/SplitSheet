# SplitSheet

![Header Image](Assets/Header.png)

A lightweight, fully interactive split-screen sheet.

- Powered by `UIScrollView` for super-smooth gestures.
- Show/hide either programmatically or with a swipe gesture.
- Gestures are fully interruptible.
- Won't affect buttons and gestures nested in subviews.
- Supports sizing detents (hidden, shown, expanded).
- Fully compatible with Auto Layout self-sizing.
- Super simple, no dependencies, ~300 lines of code.
- Replicates iOS 15's sheet detents while supporting iOS 9+.

### Usage

```swift
import Combine
import SplitSheet
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    /// Works with any view controller.
    let mainViewController = MainViewController()
    let sheetViewController = SheetViewController()
    lazy var splitSheetController = SplitSheetController(
        mainViewController: mainViewController,
        sheetViewController: sheetViewController
    )

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        /// If true, `mainViewController` will shift up as the sheet is shown.
        splitSheetController.displaceContent = true

        /// Show a grabber handle.
        splitSheetController.showHandle = true

        /// The minimum sheet height.
        splitSheetController.minimumSheetHeight = CGFloat(400)

        /// When the sheet is shown and dragged within this limit, the sheet will bounce back.
        splitSheetController.snappingDistance = CGFloat(150)

        /// How long the show/hide animation takes.
        splitSheetController.animationDuration = CGFloat(0.6)

        /// If swiping up to show the sheet is allowed or not.
        splitSheetController.swipeUpToShowAllowed = true

        /// Override the status bar color.
        splitSheetController.statusBarStyle = UIStatusBarStyle.default
        
        /// Add the sheet.
        embed(splitSheetController, inside: view)
    }

    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)

        /// Show the sheet programmatically.
        splitSheetController.show(true)
    }

    /// Propagate `splitSheetController`'s custom status bar to this view controller.
    override var childForStatusBarStyle: UIViewController? {
        return splitSheetController
    }
}
```

### Self-Sizing and Detents
It's simple — if your sheet view controller's intrinsic size is larger than the `minimumSheetHeight`, a "large" detent will be added.

```swift
class SheetViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        view.backgroundColor = .systemTeal
        view.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 800).isActive = true
    }
}
```
